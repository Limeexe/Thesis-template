\section{Background of the Problem}

It is common knowledge that the star closest to Earth is the Sun, and also that the Sun is yellow. It is this yellow sunlight which is interesting for some of its properties \cite{onate_exploring_2021}. For instance, plants, algae, and cyanobacteria convert this light into energy via photosynthesis. In \ref{fig:firstFig} is a photo of a galaxy which contains many stars.\cite{wikipediaCentralBikol}

Shown in \ref{FigureLabel}, the stars in the sky are of particular interest to the aptly, which in many recent experiments has shown promising results in converting this energy in a non-photoelectric sense into usable energy. 

Interestingly, has theorized that the famous superhero known as ``Superman'' converts the light from our sun, which grants his fantastic abilities. There are many methods in industry for converting the sun's energy (of about \SI{1000}{\watt\per\meter\squared}) into electrical energy. Some of these are highlighted in \ref{tbl:sampleTbl1}.

\section{Project Dictionary}

The Project Dictionary contains the technical terms that defined the conceptual and operation of this study:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, or ConvNet).} is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.[1] They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation equivariant responses known as feature maps.
    \item \textbf{Digital image processing} is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm \cite{CitekeyUnpublished}. 
\end{itemize}
